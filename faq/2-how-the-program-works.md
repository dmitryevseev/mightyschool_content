MightyNest gives families the opportunity to donate 15% of their purchases to their schools. The school does not need to worry about carrying product or filling orders--MightyNest will take care of everything. The school simply promotes the program to the school community (via email, post information to the school web site, or sending home a flyer or catalog). The program is headache-free for the school. It is popular with parents as well because the kids will not asked to be salespeople and only high-quality products are sold.
