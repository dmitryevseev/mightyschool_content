To find your school, enter the school's zip code and begin typing the first few letters of the school name in the school field. Only US schools with pre/K through elementary grades are currently being enrolled. If your school fits those criteria but is not on the list, please send us details to schools@mightynest.com. If your school is a middle or high school and you would like us to contact you should the program be expanded, send your information to schools@mightynest.com.
