MightyNest creates custom marketing materials for your school. Most of these materials are electronic, and can be sent to parents over email. We will send your school the exact email message, so all you have to do is hit &quot;send.&quot; We create an individual fundraising web page for your school and also communicate with parents through an opt-in newsletter containing helpful articles and tips for healthy living.
